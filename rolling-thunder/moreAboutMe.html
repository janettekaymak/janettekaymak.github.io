          Well hello! So you want to know more about me? This page is about my
          careers and hobbies.<br /><br />Work experience: When I was a young
          married adult, I was a Nurse's Aide for about four years. When my kids
          were teenagers, I taught early morning Seminary and substitute taught
          at the high school. Also, for five years in Alaska, I owned and
          operated an espresso shop, Klondike Coffee. In between making coffees,
          I created and sold over 500 crocheted "Jette Hats", each one an
          orginal design. The photo below contains 360 of them!
          <img
            class="hats"
            src="https://cdn.glitch.com/580f9041-19e8-4044-a2cb-53b5ae9593cf%2F44811195_10213028682131259_1668685001694117888_o.jpg?v=1576028216803"
            alt="A collage of about 360 crocheted hats"
            width="100%"
          /><br />
          That experience led me to Parsons the New School for Fashion Design in
          New York City. From there, I received an AAS in Fashion Design 2014.
          In my free time, which is rare since I started BYU-Idaho Online, I
          still do a little crocheting. I also like to buy clothes from thrift
          stores, then redesign and upcycle them. Here pictured below is a
          project where I made myself a top out of three of my husband's
          discarded t-shirts.<br /><img
            class="tri-shirt"

             made into one ladies blouse and being modelled by me."
            width="50%"
          /><br />
          I am attending BYU-Idaho online to finally get my BA in Professional
          Studies. After I graduate, I plan to get a job in Web Design AND
          Development because I like both the right brain and the left brain
          activity. My favorite thing about BYU-Idaho Online is how every single
          class is based on Jesus Christ. I also love how generous BYU-I is with
          counting all of my previous credits towards my Bachelor's degree.<br /><br />
          In the future, I'd like to start a non-profit organization that helps
          women like myself to start new careers and businesses. It would be for
          women in their 50's and older who don't have work or career experience
          because they spent their youth bearing and raising children and
          supporting their husbands. My greatest career, without a doubt, was
          raising my family.
