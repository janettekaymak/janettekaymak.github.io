          and a little about Mustafa
        </h2>
        <p class="first-para">
          Thank you for coming here to learn about the real person behind
          Rolling Thunder Whitewater Rafting, which incidently, is a fake
          website. My name is Janette, I'm 58 years old and I am exploring.
          Right now I am studying Web Frontend Development. I'm discovering
          that I really love the artistic side of CSS (stands for Cascading
          Style Sheet - it's how we make web pages look pretty & cool). After
          I get my Bachelor's degree, I plan to get a Master's degree in
          something creative. I'm using this last year of getting my
          Bachelor's degree to try and discover which path to take. Some
          possibilities might be Costume Design, Film Animation, TV Writing or
          Screenwriting.<br /><br /><img class="grads"
            src="images/grads.jpg" 
            alt="My husband and me in our graduation caps and gowns. His is blue from Columbia University and 
               mine is grey, from Parsons The New School for Fashion Design" width="30%" />
          I am in my second marriage and my husband's name is Mustafa. He is a
          Sundance award-winning filmmaker! (Watch
          <a href="https://vimeo.com/349561480" target="_blank">GREEN</a>) Mustafa is the age
          of my children and he is from Turkey. Some people think it's funny
          to call me a Cougar (nickname for an older woman who pursues younger
          men); however, it was the other way around because Mustafa kept
          asking me for two years before I would agree to go out with him. We
          have six grown children from my first marriage and we have seven and
          a half (there's a bun in the oven) grandchildren! My husband is
          unusually fortunate because I turned him into a grandpa when he was
          only 29 years old.<br /><br />
          I am originally from Alaska, but now I live in New York City.
          Although there is an interesting energy here and I love the
          diversity, someday I hope to move out West to be near all of my
          children and my six rowdy, ornery brothers. My dream is to buy a big
          beautiful cabin, big enough for everyone to visit, in Midway, Utah
          where my Anderson ancestors are from. That would also be a nice
          location for my film-producing husband. Sundance is nearby and
          hopping a plane to LA or NYC from the SLC airport would be a
          snap.<br /><br />

        <p class="second-para">
          Other work experience: When
          I was a young married adult, I was a Nurse's Aide for about four
          years. When my kids were teenagers, I taught early morning Seminary
          and substitute taught high school. Also, for five years in Alaska, I
          owned and operated an espresso shop, Klondike Coffee. In between
          making coffees, I created and sold over 500 crocheted "Jette Hats",
          each one an orginal design. Zoom in on the pic to see 360 of them!<br /><br />
          That experience led me to Parsons the New School for Fashion Design in
          New York City. From there, I received an AAS in Fashion Design 2014,
          but I didn't do much with that degree. I may be one of those people
          who is a professional student because it's not easy to start a
          brand new career in your 50's or 60's, unless you have extra money 
          laying around and can start your own business.<br/><br/>
          I am attending BYU-Idaho online to finally get my
          BA in Professional Studies and I am a full-time student. After I
          graduate, I plan to get a job in Web Design AND Development because
          I like both the right brain and the left brain activity. My greatest
          career was raising my family.
        </p>
        <p class="third-para">
          In 2016, I became a Massage Therapist from the Northwest Academy for
          the Healing Arts, Bellingham, Washington. Although that was a great
          experience, I decided I prefer getting massages about a hundred times
          more than giving them!<br /><br />
          If I ever become wealthy, I want to start a non-profit organization
          that helps women like myself to start new careers and businesses. It
          would be for women in their 50's and older who don't have work or
          career experience because they spent their youth bearing and raising
          children and supporting their husbands.<br /><br />
          In my free time, which is rare since I started BYU-Idaho Online, I
          crochet for my grandkids. I also like to buy clothes from thrift
          stores, then redesign and upcycle them. Here pictured is a project
          where I made myself a top out of three of my husband's discarded
          t-shirts.

        <p class="bottom-para">
          My favorite thing about BYU-Idaho Online is how every single class is
          based on Jesus Christ. I also love how
          generous BYU-I is with counting all of my previous credits towards my
          Bachelor's degree.<br /><br />I was born and raised in a
          Latter-Day-Saint family. I raised my children to love and serve the
          Lord, but fell away from the Church myself about 17 years ago. One
          year ago, I came back from 16 years of inactivity. I love going to
          the temple and appreciate it much more than I used to. Sometimes you
          have to lose something for awhile to know how wonderful it is.<br /><br />
          I owe my reactivation to the prayers, tears, and good examples of my
          children. Everyday, I am mindful that the Lord has blessed my life and
          because of his Atonement, I am enjoying His Spirit and full activity
          again!
