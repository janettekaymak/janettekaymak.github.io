                <p> Mustafa Kaymak is a Turkish/Kurdish playwright and film producer based in the United
                    States. He was born in Ankara, Turkey on July 24 1984. After graduating from Ankara University’s
                    Communication Faculty with a Journalism Degree in 2008, Kaymak immigrated to Alaska and begin studying
                    English. While at
                    Prince William Sound Community College, in beautiful Valdez AK, he fell in love with theater and 
                    decided to pursue a master's degree. In 2011, Kaymak moved to
                    New York City to begin his MFA in Playwriting at Columbia University. Upon
                    finishing his degree, he began his second MFA in Creative Film Producing, also at Columbia.
                    Kaymak’s thesis film "Green" won the short film Jury Award at Sundance Film Festival in 2019.
                </p>
                <p> Mustafa's early childhood was spent in a small village outside of Ankara called Altilar. It was
                    settled by his ancestors and Mustafa spent many happy hours playing with his
                    extensive extended family
                    in the orchard and garden. He tended sheep with the shepherds and helped on his Grandpa's
                    farm, harvesting cumin. He loved the Anatolian Sheep
                    dogs, of which the village had many. When his father became ill with MS, they moved to Ankara.
                    His
                    father died when Mustafa was
                    nine years old. He is the youngest of five children.
