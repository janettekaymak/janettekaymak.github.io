            <h5><i>by Emily DeDakis</i></h5>
            <p><i>“I have always been curious about adventure stories – events full of adrenaline.”</i></p>

            <p>Whether it’s following the American Dream or getting the job done, scapegoating or discrimination, U.S.
                society is forever telling tales about immigrants. Especially when immigrants tell their own stories,
                the
                results are rarely ‘same old’. Turkish-American journalist and filmmaker Mustafa Kaymak’s award-winning
                writing is testament to the unexpected and unflinching.</p>

            <p>His perspective is the product of a complex identity even before he emigrated: “I grew up with two
                languages
                and two identities in Ankara,” Kaymak says. “I was Kurdish at home, and Turkish everywhere else. I
                believe
                this prepared me to realize the importance of narrative, the power of language and the need for empathy
                for
                better communication. I learned that writing is a powerful tool to truly feel what it is like to be
                another
                person. Sometimes, when I wrote, I became a mute gravedigger in a gloomy cemetery, or maybe an
                undocumented
                pedicab driver struggling to make a living in Central Park.”</p>

            <p>Migration has marked his life, and his stories. In 2008, after finishing a degree in journalism, Kaymak
                left
                his hometown and moved to the U.S. “When a friend invited me to visit Alaska for the summer, immediately
                I
                accepted.” The summer in Alaska turned into three years as Kaymak met, fell in love, and moved in with
                his
                now wife.</p>

            <p>“The place and time we live in truly determines the style and the content of our writing,” Kaymak says,
                tracing how geographic and political circumstances have colored his output: “During my time in Alaska,
                with
                never-ending biting cold and dreary nights, I felt like I was on a different planet. My writings were
                mostly
                about characters trying to make sense out of their place in the world. While studying playwriting at
                Columbia University, I began to pay more attention to politics. For a while, I was interested in the
                domestic situation in Turkey and how it was influenced by world politics. The Basement was inspired from
                the
                news I was reading. I still write stories that take place in Turkey, but recently I’ve grown interested
                in
                writing about being from the Middle East and living in the USA.” <i>read more</i> . . . <a
