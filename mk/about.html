            <div id="long-bio">
                <p> Mustafa Kaymak is a Turkish playwright and film producer of Kurdish origin, based in the United
                    States. He was born in Ankara, Turkey on July 24, 1984. After graduating from Ankara University’s
                    Communication Faculty with a Journalism Degree 2008, Kaymak immigrated to Alaska and began
                    studying English. While at
                    Prince William Sound Community College, in beautiful Valdez AK, he fell in love with theater and
                    decided to pursue a master's degree. In 2011, Kaymak moved to
                    New York City to begin his MFA in Playwriting at Columbia University. Upon
                    finishing his degree, he began his second MFA in Creative Film Producing, also at Columbia.
                    Kaymak’s thesis film "Green" won the Short Film Jury Award at Sundance Film Festival 2019.
                </p>
                <p> Much of Mustafa's inspiration comes from spending every summer in the small village of Altilar, Konya. It was
                    settled by his ancestors and Mustafa spent many happy hours playing with his
                    extensive extended family
                    in the orchard and garden. He tended sheep with the shepherds and helped on his grandpa's
                    farm harvesting cumin. He loved the Anatolian sheep
                    dogs, of which the village had many. His father suffered from MS and died when Mustafa was nine years old. 
                    His mother continued to raise him and his four older siblings in Ankara, where they spent the winters.
                </p>
                <p> Mustafa and his wife Janette (nee) Hasson have been married since 2008 and they live in Upper

                    'cheerful'. Janette was born
                    and raised in the Western United States and has six children from a previous
                    marriage. She is his script editor and one of his dramaturgs. <a class="jette"
