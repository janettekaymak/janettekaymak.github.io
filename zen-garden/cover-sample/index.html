	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

				<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
				<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr
						title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr
						title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
				<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
					efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr
						title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
				<p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin
					to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.
					Become one with the web.</p>

				<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
				<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The
					Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing
					designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr
						title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed
					is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
				<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
					hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
					demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
					beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
					always push it further.</p>
