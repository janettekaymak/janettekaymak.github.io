                    </div>
                    <p> It’s 1935 in Los Angeles. Meet my Grandpa Maurice Hasson, the son of Sephardic Jews who
                        had immigrated to California from Rhodes, Turkey (now part of Greece). At 22 years-old,
                        he was given an insane job to wear a sandwich
                        board advertising the roller skates he was wearing, and roller skate from Los Angeles
                        to New York City! There he and his friend would be paid $5000. He only made it as far as Salt Lake City where
                        he met Virginia Lambert at a dance. They fell in love and were married two weeks
                        later. They settled in Provo, Utah where my dad was born. I’m gong to finish what Grandpa
                        started and I want you to come with me, <em>AND</em> be on a reality T.V. show. All proceeds
                        from the reality show will go to save our national parks!

                        will be filmed and made into a reality series by MIRACLE BABY FILMS. Tom Hanks (Forest Gump) is
                        on board to star in the series! We are seeking people who will shine on film, so if this is you,
                        fill out an application, send a full body photo of yourself, plus a video of you telling us why
                        you want to participate. Twenty semi-finalists will be invited to Salt Lake City to be
                        interviewed by our panel of judges. After a gala evening with TOM HANKS and SUSAN PIERCE
                        THOMPSON in attendance, ten finalists will be selected and announced!

                    </div>
                    <p>A little bit about me, Janette Kaymak: I am originally from Valdez, Alaska, but now I live in New
                        York City. I'm a 59 year-old mother of six, grandmother of eight, fur-mommy to an adorable
                        Morkie, and wife of Mustafa the Remarkable Movie Producer. After reaching an all time high of
                        249 lbs, I was sad and frustrated. I had tried almost every diet available. They would work for
                        a while, but eventually I would figure out a way to eat too much and sabotage my efforts. After
                        discovering Bright Line Eating by Susan Pierce Thompson, I realized I was a food addict. So, I
                        gave up flour and sugar, I weighed my food, and I ate three meals a day. No exercise was
                        required because precious willpower needs to be preserved for the
                        eating program. It was so simple and yet so difficult, all at the same time, but it worked! I
                        lost 40 lbs in five months. I am a “Bright Lifer” meaning I will eat this way for the rest of my
                        life. I plan on losing 40 more lbs in the next five months, but this project will make it happen
                        faster! Come with me, eat Bright Line meals and lose a bunch of weight, while helping to save
                        our National Parks! Even if you can't come roller skate with me, check out BRIGHT LINE EATING by

                    <p>Are you excited about this project and passionate about fitness, but just need a good excuse to
                        get off your duff and do something about it? You must be 35 to 65 pounds overweight and in
                        decent health, which will be determined by your doctor. Print out the application, take it to
                        your doctor and have them fill out the medical portion. If you qualify, fill out the rest of the
                        application and scan it. Next, along with the required photo and video, send it to
                        <u>miraclebabyfilms@live.com</u>. If you are selected, you will be sent a pair of Acme quad
                        roller skates and begin conditioning yourself to skate at least ten miles to start with.
                        Departure date is May 15, 2020. ETA is September 15, 2020. If you are among the twenty
                        semi-finalists, you'll receive a one way ticket to Salt Lake City for the convention on May
                        13th. If you are selected as one of the ten finalists, you must be ready to depart on May 15th.
                        If you are not selected, we'll provide your transportation home. If you make it to NYC, we will
                        donate $50,000 in your name to save our national parks!
